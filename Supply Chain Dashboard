 Supply Chain Performance Dashboard

Objective
The Supply Chain Performance Dashboard is designed to provide real-time insights** into key supply chain metrics such as order fulfillment, inventory turnover, stock levels, and demand forecasting. 
The goal is to help businesses:  
1) Optimize inventory management  
2) Reduce stockouts and overstock situations  
3) Improve order fulfillment efficiency  
4) Forecast demand trends for better planning  

Process & Data Flow

1️. Data Collection & Storage 
   - Extracted data from **historical sales, inventory, and supplier records**.  
   - Used a Dimension and fact tables (e.g., Order, Suppliers, Inventory).  

2️. Data Cleaning & Transformation
   - Handled the date consistency using the power Query.  
   - And did the data modelling among the dimension and the facts table
   - Created the required DAX query like:
     ✔ Date Table
     ✔ Inventory Turnover Ratio
     ✔ Reorder Alert
     ✔ Order Fulfillment Rate (%)  
     ✔ On Time delivery
     ✔ Average Lead Time 


3️. Dashboard Development (Power BI) 
   - Built interactive visuals to analyze supply chain efficiency:  
     - Gauge Chart → Tracks order fulfillment rate  
     - Line Chart → Shows inventory turnover trends  
     - Bar Charts → Analyzes stock levels by category  
     - Conditional Formatting → Highlights critical reorder alerts  

 
 Interpretation & Insights

🔹 Order Fulfillment Rate (38%) → Indicates efficiency in delivering orders on time. Low values suggest delays in supplier performance.  

🔹 Stock Level Alerts (Table with Red Highlights) → Identifies products that need immediate restocking to avoid lost sales.  

🔹 Inventory Turnover Trend (Line Chart) → Shows seasonal fluctuations, helping businesses optimize stock replenishment cycles.  

🔹 Demand Forecasting (Using ML & Trends Data) → Enables predictive analytics for inventory planning based on historical & real-time trends.  

Key Technologies Used 
- Power BI → Data visualization & analytics  
- DAX → Custom measures & calculated fields  

      1.Date Time : DateTable =  
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDAR(DATE(2024, 02, 15), DATE(2025, 02, 25)),  
    "Year", YEAR([Date]),
    "Month", FORMAT([Date], "MMMM"),  -- Full Month Name (January, February, etc.)
    "Month Number", MONTH([Date]),  -- Numeric Month (1-12)
    "Quarter", "Q" & FORMAT([Date], "Q"),  -- Quarter (Q1, Q2, etc.)
    "Week Number", WEEKNUM([Date]),  -- Week of the Year
    "Day of Week", FORMAT([Date], "dddd"),  -- Day Name (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
    "Day of Week Number", WEEKDAY([Date])  -- Numeric Day (1 = Sunday, 7 = Saturday))

2. Inventory Turnover = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(Orders[Order_ID]), 
    AVERAGE(Inventory[Stock_Level]), 
    0)

3. Reorder Alert = IF(
    SUM(Inventory[Stock_Level]) <= SUM(Inventory[Reorder_Point]),"Need to Reorder", "Sufficient Goods")

4. On time Delivery = 
var total_orders= COUNT(Orders[Order_ID])
VAR On_Time_delivery = COUNTROWS(FILTER(Orders,Orders[Shipment_Date] <= Orders[Shipment_Date]+5))

RETURN
DIVIDE(On_Time_delivery,total_orders,0)*100

5. Average Cost Per Order = AVERAGE(Suppliers[Cost_Per_Order])

6. Average Lead time = AVERAGE(Suppliers[Lead_Time])

7. Lead Time Alert = IF(SELECTEDVALUE(Suppliers[Lead_Time]) > [Average Lead time], "🔴" ,"🟢")
